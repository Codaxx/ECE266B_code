ECE266B/ECE284 SAR ADC Testing Repository

This repository serves as a reference for the ECE266B (also listed as ECE284) course at UC San Diego. The primary objective of this course is to test a SAR ADC using a customized PCB board.

The code in this repository is designed to automate the testing procedure utilizing Keysight equipment, including:

    Power sources
    Oscilloscopes
    Function generators

This automation streamlines the data collection and evaluation process, ensuring efficient and precise testing of the SAR ADC.
